Hi there!
Today we'll be writing tests ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚ðŸ™‚. 

# Info
You should create a new project for this homework, include file from the task1 and task2 folder, you can use the same project for both of them. Just create separate TestCase classes for them. You may create either iOS or macOS project.

# Task 1: Bank account testing (5 points)
## 0.5 points per test, but no more than 5 points
You have a class `BankAccount` and `Transaction` in the task1 folder. You should write tests for this class. You should test all methods and properties of the class. You should write at least 10 tests. Those tests should cover all possible cases and do not cover same logic (aka, adding different amount of money by using deposit function, and so on).

# Task 2: TDD (5 points)
## 5 points
You have a ShoppingCart project in the task2 folder. You should implement the `ShoppingCart` and `Coupon` class using TDD. You have 12 tests, make the, all pass. You should not change the tests.

# Task 3 (optional): UI Tests (3 points)
Write UI tests for the project from the previous Homework. You should write at least 3 tests per controller/screen.
You may verify that the spinner is shown, the image is loaded, the buttons are working, and so on.
